To FIS Recruiting Co-ordinators,

Dear Sir/Madam,

As a Computer Science and Informatics Professor (Should we mention North America, specially USA and CANADa) at Indiana University, McMaster University, and Seneca College - I notice first hand how challenging it is for even highly qualified recent graduates to enter into the workforce. On the other hand, industrial demand for quality IT professionals are growing and finding a qulity professional is always a challenge. My company Aamira strives to bridge this gap for highly skilled (both technically and theoritically)and motivated resources ranging from recent graduates with stellar academic performance to seasoned research engineers with years of professional experience in applications such as Fidelity's Profile Enterprise Banking platform, COBOL, Java Enterprise Application Architecture.

On helaf of my company I would relish the opportunity to meet and discuss with you the placement process of such highy qualified resources at a rate that we believe is highly competitive.
