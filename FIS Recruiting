To FIS Recruiting Co-ordinators,

Dear Sir/Madam,

As a Professor at Indiana State University - I notice first hand how challenging it is for recent graduates to enter into the workforce. More surprisingly, many post-doc research colleagues have also expressed similar concerns despite being quite skilled in our industry. My company Aamira strives to bridge this gap for highly skilled and motivated resources ranging from recent graduates with stellar academic performance to seasoned research engineers with years of professional experience in applications such as Fidelity's Profile Enterprise Banking platform, COBOL, Java Enterprise Application Architecture...

My company's CEO (your brother?) and I would relish the opportunity to meet and discuss with you the placement of such resources at a rate that we believe is highly competitive. Our resources include:
* Position - years experience - skill - estimate cost
